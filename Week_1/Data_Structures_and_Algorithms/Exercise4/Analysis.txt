Time Complexity:
Add- O(1) 
Search- O(n) 
Traverse- O(n) 
Delete- O(n) 

Limitations of Arrays:
Fixed size that canâ€™t be changed.
Inefficient for frequent insertions/deletions due to shifting.
Less flexible compared to dynamic data structures like lists or maps.

When to Use Arrays:
When the number of elements is fixed.
When quick access by index is needed.
For simple datasets where resizing and frequent changes aren't required.
