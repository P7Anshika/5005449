Linear Search:
Time Complexity- O(n)
Best Case- O(1) 
Average Case- O(n) 
Worst Case- O(n) 


Binary Search:
Time Complexity- O(log n)
Best Case: O(1) 
Average Case: O(log n)
Worst Case: O(log n) 

For an e-commerce platform with large datasets and sorted products, binary search is more efficient due to its faster logarithmic time complexity.
