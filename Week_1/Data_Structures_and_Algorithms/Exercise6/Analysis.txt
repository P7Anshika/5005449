Linear Search:
Time Complexity-O(n)
Useful for unsorted or small datasets. Simple to implement.

Binary Search:
Time Complexity- O(logn)
Efficient for large, sorted datasets. Requires the list to be sorted.


Linear Search is better for smaller or unsorted lists.
Binary Search is preferred for larger datasets that are already sorted or can be sorted, providing faster search times due to its logarithmic complexity.
