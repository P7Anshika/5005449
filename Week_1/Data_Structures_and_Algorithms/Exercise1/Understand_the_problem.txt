Data structures are essential:
Data structures organize and manage inventory data to speed up operations like searching and updating, ensuring the system handles growth without performance issues.

suitable data structures:
i. ArrayList- Good for dynamic resizing and fast access by index, but slow for insertion and deletion due to shifting elements.
ii.HashMap- Ideal for quick data access with unique keys, offering average constant time for insertions, deletions, and lookups.
