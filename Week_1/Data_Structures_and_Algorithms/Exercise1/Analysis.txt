Time complexity of eaach operation:
Add Operation (addProduct)- Average time complexity is O(1), as HashMap handles additions quickly with hashing.
Update Operation (updateProduct)- Average time complexity is O(1), since HashMap updates are fast if the key exists.
Delete Operation (deleteProduct)- Average time complexity is O(1), with HashMap efficiently removing items.

Optimization:
HashMap efficiently manages add, update, and delete operations with average O(1) complexity. Ensure optimal capacity and load factor to reduce rehashing and include robust error handling.
