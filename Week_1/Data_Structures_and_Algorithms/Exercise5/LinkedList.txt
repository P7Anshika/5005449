Singly Linked List: 
Nodes are linked in one direction; each node points to the next, and the last node points to null. Efficient for inserting and deleting at the beginning but slower for operations in the middle or end.

Doubly Linked List: 
Nodes are linked in both directions; each node points to both the next and previous nodes. This allows for easy traversal in both directions and efficient insertions and deletions at both ends.
