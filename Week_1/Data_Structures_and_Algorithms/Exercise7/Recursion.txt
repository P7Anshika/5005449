Recursion involves a function calling itself to solve smaller parts of a problem, breaking it into simpler steps, often resulting in cleaner and more readable code.


Benefits:
 Makes complex problems easier to understand and code by directly addressing smaller versions of the same problem.
 Effectively handles problems that can be broken into similar sub-problems, like sorting or tree traversal.
