Time Complexity:
O(n), where n is the number of recursive calls. Each call reduces the problem size by 1, leading to a linear number of calls.

Optimization:
Memoization- Store results of expensive recursive calls to avoid redundant computations.
Iterative Approach- For problems with deep recursion, an iterative approach may be more efficient and avoid stack overflow errors.
